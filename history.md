# scssify change log
## 2016-11-02 v2.2.0
Bump node-sass to `^3.10.1` from `^3.3.1` to ensure node 7 support.

Also upgraded some dev dependencies.

## 2016-08-10 v2.1.0
Breaking changes:
- removed `useNodeEnv` option; this was a bad idea.

New features:
- browserify's `--debug` option will also enable css sourcemaps. No extra configuration needed!

## 2016-08-09 v2.0.0
Breaking changes:
- `<link>` tag injection removed. `<style>` tags are now the default [#14](https://github.com/cody-greene/scssify/issues/14)
- `opt.autoInject` may now be one of `true|false|'verbose'`
- `postcss` is no longer a hard dependency. Install it yourself if you need it.

New features:
- added `useNodeEnv` option. Will enable sourcemaps if `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` otherwise uses `'compressed'` output

Fixes:
- use pre-formatted error text from node-sass
- handle postcss errors
- sourcemaps should work [#15](https://github.com/cody-greene/scssify/issues/15)

## 2016-06-16 v1.2.0
New features:
- [[`2963d08`](https://github.com/cody-greene/scssify/commit/2963d08)] allowing for importer factory functions - this will let the importer state be reset if scssify is called several times within the same process, e.g. by factor-bundle

## 2016-05-16 v1.1.0
New features:
- [[`002a0ad`](https://github.com/cody-greene/scssify/commit/002a0ad)] load custom importer files: this means you can set a custom sass importer in `package.json:browserify.transform`, like the `--importer` flag when using `node-sass` directly

## 2016-04-20 v1.0.0 *breaking changes*
The project is no longer transpiled before publishing; Node.js `4.0.0` & up is now required. The package is also a bit smaller now since the `lodash` and `browserify-transform-tools` dependencies have been removed. Hurray for fewer dependencies!

New features:
- [[`0d00236`](https://github.com/cody-greene/scssify/commit/0d00236)] add `--export` option, default: `false`, this means that raw css is no longer exported, greatly reducing file-size if you're just using autoInjection

## 2016-04-17 v0.3.8
Under new management. [Chris Hoage](https://github.com/chrishoage) has transferred this project over to me so here's a long awaited bugfix!

- [[`507d912`](https://github.com/cody-greene/scssify/commit/507d912)] inform browserify about @imported files [#1](https://github.com/cody-greene/scssify/issues/1)
